# Challenge1
The first challenge in the class, using string matching query on data from Wikipedia

As the data files are to large to include here. We downloaded <b>enwiki-20170820-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2</b> found here https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dump_torrents

From that you can decompress and create "wiki_big" which you will have to parse using parse_wiki.py to be able to get "wiki_cat", "wiki_only_a" and "wiki_all".

Once you have those files you are able to run query.py and find some queries
